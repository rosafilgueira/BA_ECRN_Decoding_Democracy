      <td>There shouldn't be any arrangements full stop. Putting aside that any vote without our real Government in Westminster's approval would be illegal, this proposed "Bill" is a disgrace - the SNP have lied to the Scottish people about the last independence vote being a "once in a lifetime" opportunity and are continuing to fail the country by focusing on continual anti-Tory rhetoric, stoking up resentment with unfounded claims of xenophobia following the Brexit vote and using a bullshit argument that the only reason Scots voted to remain in the UK was to stay part of the EU, (nothing to do with the lack of any SNP plan for an independent Scotland that is not utter fantasy!). \r The SNP should be ashamed of themselves. They have spent almost the last decade running this country into the ground and blaming "Westmonster". Given their economic arguments they obviously have no clue how to run a country and are LUCKY to be part of the UK and its ability to pay Scotland's way. Raising a new referendum is either an attempt to disguise that fact, or, purely an attempt by Sturgeon to cling to control of this cultist party - not exactly "Stronger for Scotland" is it? \r Saying that because "Scotland" voting to "remain" in the Brexit referendum is a reason for Scotland to have a re-run of the independence vote is like saying Dumfriesshire, Orkney &amp; Shetland and Edinburgh South should have their own governments because they didn't vote for the morally corrupt SNP!</td>
      <td>Voting in any referendum or election should be for those aged 18 and over - the SNP have only introduced voting for 16 and 17 year olds in an attempt to win the last independence vote. Just like the Nazis in the 1930's, the SNP are trying to brainwash the young and easily influenced. If they can fool 51 percent of the population and insult the intelligence of the remaining 49 percent to win independence, then that is exactly what the SNP will do.\r The SNP gave the vote to 16/17 year olds saying they should get a say. Bollocks. If 16/17 year olds were mature enough and had sufficient life experience to make an informed decision, then they shouldn't have an SNP Snooper, (aka Named Person), they should be allowed to drink, smoke and watch porn or violent films and they sure as hell should be named and shamed when they commit a crime!!</td>
      <td>I don't think this will matter. When you see the SNP/Scottish Government ignoring the democratic will of the people per the last indy vote and ignoring polls showing that the majority of Scots DO NOT WANT ANOTHER REFERENDUM; if you also look at the various press reports about SNP members, (even elected representatives), breaking election rules and being investigated by the police for fraud, embezzlement, etc, then what chance has democracy got anyway? On the evidence I have seen the SNP will lie and cheat to get what they want anyway and screw everybody else.</td>

      <td>I feel that all the changes proposed here, seem sensible and in line with concerns raised after the 2014. I would however raise the point on Emergency Proxy, it is obvious that the difference in the number of applications between the European Parliament and and referendum was in part due to turn out and an increased sense among the electorate that the vote mattered. I would therefore caution against reaction of access to emergency proxy on the grounds that it causes excessive burden on local authorities, while I accept some controls need to exist I would hope other solutions could be found.</td>

      <td>The Draft Scottish Independence Referendum Bill is out today for consultation. You can add your voice to the consultation online (either as an individual or representing a business) via this link. I have just done so stating, as follows:\r"I am very pleased to see these proposed arrangements. They concur with the Scottish Government's mandate further to the SNP manifesto commitment earlier in the year. Needless to say, this is within the context of the EU referendum, threatened Brexit, alongside Scotland's overwhelming Remain vote.\rRunning a small business in Scotland I see that this consultation as an essential step in reserving Scotland's position should the UK government fail to respect Scotland's remain vote and their 2014 promise that we would be an "equal partner" in a family of nations. For Scotland to be dragged out of the EU and especially the single market, against our will would not only be democratically indefensible but also extremely damaging to the Scottish economy as recently outlined by the Fraser of Allander Institute."</td>

It was to be a once in a lifetime event. This further referendum is a breach of that commitment to the people of Scotland and is thus driven by a few politicians rather than the people.  I presume the intent is that if enough referendums are held then the chance of the 'few' politicians wishes being enacted becomes more likely.  This is fundamentally undemocratic.</td>

      <td>I agree wholeheartedly with the idea that those who make Scotland their home have the right to vote on its future, it's their country too after-all, however I have two concerns.\r Firstly, I believe, though I may be wrong, (non British) EU citizens gain their ability to vote in Local elections and the Scottish Parliament elections through EU rules on reciprocity, I worry that this might come into conflict considering the very fact that the catalyst for this potential referendum is the vote to leave the EU, essentially I think safeguards should be put in place so that should there be a vote after the UK has officially left the EU, those people will maintain their right to vote.\r Secondly, I believe there around 200,000 people in Scotland not born anywhere in the EU who don't qualify for a vote whatsoever, I would suggest that the franchise be expanded to include them as that is in keeping with the idea that those who build a life for themselves here deserve a say on this country no matter where they came from originally.\r I am in absolute agreement with the continued provision for 16 and 17 year old voters, personally I fail to see why it is even considered an issue.\r I agree with the restrictions on an Emergency proxy vote as its function is to ensure those who can't make it to vote get a chance to do so.\r In terms of postal votes, I still worry about the potential for misuse and coercion and would suggest that the need for an individual to fill out their ballot themselves be more heavily emphasised on the form, even providing instructions should coercion be attempted, perhaps a look at safeguards in general for this is needed not just for this specific proposed vote.\r I do agree with 100% checking.\r I agree that the returning officer should not knowingly appoint those who have actively campaigned to count votes however safeguards should be made to ensure neither "side" can take advantage of this rule by flippantly identifying anyone they know to be supportive (though not a campaigner) of a particular option in an attempt to stack the decks themselves so to speak.\r I agree completely with the issuing of verification statements.</td>
      <td>I agree with ensuring that a permitted participant should be required to be aware of the fact of what they're doing and the responsibilities they are taking on.\r I also agree that those seeking to use official campaigns to promote offensive names should be disallowed from doing so.\r i agree that a political partys campaign officer should be allowed to take on the role of a responsible person.</td>

      <td>Scottish Parliament and local authority elections are NOT based on residency. They are based on nationality. The clue is in the fact that people have to have been born in a country that has some sort of international arrangement with the UK, be it as a fellow member of the EU, or as a fellow Commonwealth member, which is effectively a list of countries that the British Empire invaded to extract their natural resources and enslave their people.\r This referendum (and our elections in general, but I'm going to be pushing that as an issue through my party's decision-making structures separately) should be based on residency, not nationality. Currently, residents hailing from our near neighbours Iceland and Norway are unable to vote in Scottish elections, just because their "home" nations have decided not to join the EU. Yet people from Vanuatu and Tuvalu on the other side of the globe can vote because their countries were once part of the British Empire.\r Open the franchise to every person who is permanently resident in Scotland, regardless of nationality or citizenship.\r As for postal voting, for such a critical vote, I don't think it's too much to ask people to ensure they make an effort to be available to vote on the day. Postal vote eligibility should be restricted to those who are physically unable to make it to a polling station. Postal vote applications have expanded to the point that some people get them simply for convenience. This is a vote with huge importance. If casting that vote in person is too inconvenient, then you are clearly not taking it seriously enough.</td>

      <td>On eligibility, while I appreciate that voters are tied in to electoral rules of eligibility with regards to voting in local elections I would like to point out that there are people who are resident in Scotland and have been for some time and who have a right to live and work (set out by the Home Office) due to their marital relationships with UK and EU citizens but are unable to vote due to not being a UK, Commonwealth or EU citizen themselves. While I don't seek for those rules to be changed (as this would require some legislative amendments at Westminster), it's worth pointing out that not all those "who reside in Scotland" are able to vote.\r On postal voting specifically, the last time around we heard many stories of people who had changed their minds after casting their postal vote. It may be useful to consider a rule whereby a postal vote may be overruled by the person turning up to vote in person on polling day if they choose to do so.\r On counting, the most important thing is to ensure the safety of all ballots to the counting place and make sure no one has access to those ballots until they are all fully counted. Again there were stories of certain politicians having gained access to ballots before they were fully counted which should never happen.</td>

      <td>The arrangements for managing the referendum are well set out, and previously worked well during the 2014 referendum. This was a simple process for both the voters and the Electoral Management Board (to my knowledge). The 2014 referendum also had one of the highest turnouts of recent times for any such governmental election and I believe having such a well set out process aided this. I would be more than happy for the same arrangements to be in place for any future referendum.</td>
      <td>I agree with the majority of the outline for eligibility to vote, with the following exception. I feel that those members of the House of Lords resident in Scotland may have a clash of interest with regards to their Lordship within the House and also being an active resident within Scotland. Although I believe they should be allowed to vote, as are all politicians, I believe they should not be permitted to use their stats as members of the House to attempt to persuade the general public to vote in a specific way. The exception to this would be if they were part of the official Yes/No campaigns and were therefore permitted to do so.\r I also agree with the decision to exclude counting officers who have been involved in campaigning during the referendum. I have full confidence in the counting process and this will go further to reaffirm the general public of a accurate and honest outcome.</td>

      <td>I believe the wording of the proposed referendum is unfair. In the EU referendum, the electoral commission vetoed the use of a yes/no question, given the positive implications of a 'yes' vote and the negative implications of a 'no' vote. If the question read 'Should Scotland remain in the United Kingdom - Yes/No' this would be equally unfair. \rThe question should read along the lines of:\rShould Scotland remain in the United Kingdom or become an independent country?\r1) Scotland should remain in the United Kingdom\r2) Scotland should become an independent country. \r I think this would prevent the pro-independence side from being overly positive and optimistic, and prevent the pro-union side from being overly negative and pessimistic. This would allow the campaigns to focus purely on issues, rather than emotive issues of positivity/negativity.  \r It should be noted that polling consistently shows that a majority of respondents oppose the holding of a referendum at this stage, and this majority is greater than the current majority in the polls for a 'No' vote. Therefore, across potential 'Yes' and 'No' voters, only a minority support another referendum. There should be no referendum until polling consistently shows majority support for the holding of another referendum, irrespective of which way people plan to vote.</td>

      <td>I don't think a second referendum on whether or not the Scottish parliament should be independent of the UK parliament in its decision-making should be arranged in the form of a plebiscite. As we saw with the last independence referendum, and have seen more recently with the referendum on the UK's membership of the EU, plebiscites are socially divisive, are vulnerable to politically motivated misdirection and misinformation, and do not produce decisive results.\r There are other arrangements that governments can make to refer matters to its citizens, which are much less divisive, less open to political chicanery, and produce decisive outcomes. Something along the lines of having a citizens' jury (twelve angry wo/men, chosen by lot, to 'try' the proposal that Scotland should be an independent country (or whatever the proposal will be this time around), with advocates for and against the proposal (Nicola and Ruth?) presenting the respective cases and cross-examining their [expert] witnesses, under the oversight of a presiding judge to ensure the procedural rectitude of the solemn proceedings. And the whole proceedings would be live-streamed for public scrutiny.  This is just one of a range of possible democratic alternatives to the blunt instrument of a general plebiscite vote.\r I would like to see the range of possible alternative arrangements considered in deciding how a second referendum would be managed.

Regardless of whether they are or are not, they need to have the appearance of being secure and honest if disputes and conspiracies are to be avoided after the result. The Crimean referendum highlights issues of trust, impartiality, and access even if a referendum has international observers. The absence of exit polls in the 2014 referendum added to the mistrust. I do not propose a solution to this but during the consultation phase it would be a good idea to take ideas from the more trusted democracies with experience of referendums such as Switzerland, Netherlands and Denmark. The UK has little experience of referendums (despite the recent EU referendum).</td>

      <td>The amendment regarding eligibility to vote does not have any practical impact, it is simply an update on wording to take account of the change in legislation when the Scottish Elections (Reduction of Voting Age) Act 2015 was introduced.\r An increase of 7,770% in emergency proxy applications caused administrative difficulties in 2014. Even if this level of emergency proxy applications could be managed administratively, there is no justification in allowing anyone to exceed the cut-off date where they could have reasonably been expected to submit a normal proxy application. The amendment addresses this issue whilst still providing for those who genuinely need an emergency proxy vote and it also brings the procedures into line with other elections. \r Increasing the checking of personal identifiers from a minimum of 20% to 100% will help ensure the legitimacy of postal votes and it will go a long way to improve public confidence in the postal vote system. \r Introducing measures to ensure those who have actively campaigned for any outcome in the referendum will also help to improve public confidence in the system. Whilst public confidence in how the 2014 referendum was run overall was very high, it is right that steps are taken to address concerns about specific aspects of they system where they arise. This amendment doesn't reflect on the integrity of those who campaign in the referendum but it is however a reasonable precautionary measure.</td>

      <td>The availability of postal and proxy votes should be severely restricted to those who have good reason to require them and recipients should be audited to ensure there is no fraud. Wherever possible, voters should have to attend their polling station in person.\r There needs to be a detailed audit of the electoral register to ensure that there is no fraud. \r All voters should be required to produce identification at polling stations.\r Postal votes must remain in Scotland at suitably secure locations. When checking the voter statements, there should be no need to open the second envelope. The second envelopes must not be opened until after the polls close. Postal votes must be opened and envelopes separated to a secured place before ballot boxes are opened.\r Those who own property in Scotland but are not ordinarily resident here should not be entitled to vote and an audit of this aspect of the electoral register should be carried out.\r Service personnel whose families reside outside of Scotland should not be entitled to vote unless they can prove that they themselves permanently reside in Scotland. By way of example, a submariner whose family lives outside of Scotland and who is shore based at Faslane for brief periods between deployments and shore leave should not be entitled to vote. Only those whose principal place of residence is in Scotland should be allowed to vote and an audit of this part of the electoral register should be carried out.\r The procedures for sealing and transportation of ballot boxes needs to be considerably tightened. At least one representative from each side of the campaign must observe the ballot boxes throughout the election and count process.\r Independent international experts should review the Referendum Bill and related procedures to identify any potential weaknesses, based on best practices in other countries, before the Bill is passed.\r Independent international observers should witness the conduct of the referendum and have the authority to request the police to intervene if they witness any breaches of procedures. They should produce a report following the referendum detailing their findings.\r Training of all officials and observers that will be on duty at every part of the referendum process needs to be greatly improved. Their competence needs to be assessed before and during the referendum process by examinations prior to the referendum and by independent and anonymous auditing at any point during the process. By way of example, an auditor should be able to ask a question of staff at polling stations and the polling station staff should be assessed based upon their response. During the 2014 referendum, far too many staff were inadequately trained and did not understand the rules and procedures. Complaints about this to officials after the referendum were dismissed with the suggestion that any complaints required a petition to the Court of Session. The unwillingness of officials to investigate legitimate concerns was disturbing and the fact that these officials made no reference to such concerns in the final report into the conduct of the referendum is a significant cause for concern. This despite the fact that these officials admitted widespread breach of procedures during the counts.\r In summary, the UK electoral system has significant weaknesses and many of these are well documented. The next independence referendum needs to comply with best international practices.</td>

      <td>It is vital that any referendum should be conducted with impartial foreign observers to ensure that the result is not rigged. It is also necessary to remove postal voting due to the many cases of electoral fraud throughout the UK in recent years. People who only come to stay for short term breaks in their second/holiday homes should be excluded as should those who have only been resident in Scotland for a short time, eg 3 months or less, as we were all aware of people coming to Scotland for a short stay in order to obtain a vote in the 2014 referendum, and these people do not have any stake in progressing  Scotland. Finally, it is essential that the Scottish Parliament take some action to counteract the tsunami of dreadful unionist propaganda and smear campaigns in the media including television. This has to be made illegal, and must be enforced.</td>
      <td>This goes some way towards addressing my concerns but I still believe that the postal vote can be used to manipulate the result. I would also prefer the Electoral Commission to be removed from having any control over the referendum.</td>
      <td>I have no faith in the integrity of the electoral commission, but there does need to be some control over who finances what in campaign spending - big business donations should be disallowed, as should large donations from non-residents.</td>

      <td>I do not believe there is cause for a second referendum, particularly this soon after the first.  The main reason for revisiting being the result of the EU referendum is unjustifiable.  The fact remains that in the first referendum the majority of the voters in this country, Scotland, exercised their democratic right to vote to remain as part of the UK and in doing so, voted to agree to remain part of that national democratic process.  I was one such individual who voted to remain in the UK and in doing so accepted that any future UK level democratic votes would be won or lost based on the majority view of UK citizens as a whole, not only those living in Scotland.  I voted to remain in the EU and the fact is that compared to other citizens of the UK, I was in the minority.  That is democracy. \r I accept that the majority of people living in Scotland also voted to remain in the EU, however this cannot be viewed as a reason to hold a second referendum without grossly undermining the democratic process that the majority of people living in Scotland voted to remain part of only two years ago.\r On the day following the announcement of the result of the first Scottish referendum, the then First Minister Alex Salmond stood before the nation and stated that those Scots who voted to remain part of the UK should, "be ashamed".  That comment alone, showed a shocking level of contempt and disrespect for democracy and it is no surprise that two years on, the SNP Government are positioning to run a second referendum.\r I voted to remain in the UK and in the EU.   What of democracy if the situation is to arise where if find myself living in an independent Scotland as an EU citizen, despite being in the majority when I voted in the first Scottish Referendum and in the minority when I voted in the EU referendum?</td>

Fairly straightforward to have a system where proof of birth in Scotland, or significant residence in Scotland could allow that individual to vote.

Why this was not implemented previously is beyond me and every other yes voter that I have spoken to?.\r Any ballot papers being transported between polling station and counting station should be accompanied by both YES &amp; NO voters, (in addition to police/security) to their final destination and they should verify the integrity &amp; security of the process at each step..\r I would prefer no postal voting whatsoever as this is the most easily manipulated aspect of the system integrity.. If people feel strongly then they will reach a polling station. However, as this may be impracticable then every postal vote must be counted in Scotland and a cast iron security verification system put in place to ensure that no one, (even Tories) have access to how people voted until the night of the vote.\r  24 hr security by both yes &amp; No voters and international observers must be with all ballot papers until they are counted.\r International observers from western &amp; non western aligned.nations should be included in the security &amp; verification process of both postal and polling station votes.\r Should any future result go against YES by a very small % then the Scottish Govt should not officially immediately accept the vote until all systems have confirmed that they were satisfied that the system integrity had been maintained.\r Saor Alba...</td>

If postal voting is to be permitted at all, I would also want postal votes from institutions such as retiral homes to be scrutinised most carefully to ensure that there is no possibility that such votes could be completed on behalf of, rather than actually by, the residents of those institutions.\r In view of the current UK process of removal from the EU, I suggest that it be specifically stated that residents who were EU citizens at the date of introduction of the referendum bill should be entitled to vote irrespective of their residency status on the date of the poll.</td>

It would be better mirroring the EU referendum with a question "Should Scotland remain a part of the United Kingdom or leave the United Kingdom?" With a "remain" or "leave" response.

      <td>I am generally in agreement, but I would recommend a few additions;\r Any and all security seals on ballot boxes  MUST be recorded and signed off, otherwise no point in having them. I believe that in areas like Highlands, staff were specifically instructed NOT to do so. Not recording them, and matching with box numbers negates the entire reason for having them, as a measure against tampering. I feel this is of utmost importance.\r The public should be made fully aware of the layout of the ballot slips, front and back, in order to deal with the uncertainty about barcodes. Any without barcodes should be discarded. Ideally all should be sourced from one print company only. There still seems to be a lot of confusion and debate over this. It may seem petty, but an official poster notifying people of this at each voting place should be displayed prominently.\r It may be an idea for people to be able to note the barcode number, if they wish for their ballot to be reexamined at a later date.\r Ballots should be held for longer after the referendum, possibly 3 to 6 months, bearing in mind the importance of the vote.\r I would like to see an external body, such as the EU or even the UN involved in oversight in some manner, possibly providing observers, since it effectively involves the status of a country on an international level. Failing that, some sort of body of international observers should be required.\r Would it be possible to install one or more webcams at each counting centre giving an overview of the counting hall? This need not be able to clearly show votes on ballot slips, but could give a greater idea of what is happening, and be available to anyone interested.\r Requirement for identity verification should be much more stringent. Either the polling card or two forms of ID would help combat any possibility of misrepresentation.\r Postal ballots should NOT be taken away for "verification", or whatever, as there is no reason for the boxes to be opened more than once. They should either remain secure until counting at a predetermined site, or they should be counted immediately as soon as the deadline has passed, and the results stored securely somewhere. \r With regard to observation of postal ballot boxes being opened, controls should be tightened up with regards to people attempting to ascertain the results, especially if they are likely to brag about it on television. (Yes, this is a deliberate dig about a certain person)\r Much tighter security should be given to transportation of ballot boxes to counting centres, or they should be opened and counted at the ballot centres where possible. Where there is any reason for a venue to be evacuated, cctv footage should remain live and available for all to reduce opportunities for tampering.\r During transportation of any ballot boxes, security should be stepped up. All boxes, and associated security tag numbers should be signed for by a driver/pilot, and a separate guard of some sort. Any transport vehicles should be accompanied by another. Special arrangements or dispensation could be made where transport is by water or air, as this adds its own complications, and would be expected to be of minimal effect.\r In addition to, and separate from these recommendations, I don't know how feasible it would be to compile a centralised list of all irregularities associated with the vote, and how they were addressed. This would give an idea of actual issues present, and also where some people feel reported complaints have been ignored, then they could check for themselves, and how they were handled.\r I would also like to see some sort of exit poll carried out, in order for us to be able to compare with the declared result. \r Much more stringent regulation of presentation of information in the final weeks before the count should be in place. In the case of 2014, one of the excuses I heard was that the government, as a body did not present additional information, but INDIVIDUALS, who were, coincidentally MEMBERS of this government or associated with them, presented evidence. This should be addressed at the outset.</td>

If so, then would it be possible to NOT have them sent elsewhere for "validation"?\r I agree totally that proxy votes should be restricted to those who have a valid reason, such as mobility, or service personnel.</td>

      <td>All the technical details seem fine to me, though I have no expertise in this area, however there is one issue that I think hasn't been addressed. \r Even as an independence supporter, it seems clear to me that many people, No voters especially, found the previous independence referendum highly stressful. Furthermore, there is a perception amongst a significant minority of voters in Scotland and in the rest of the UK, that independence has become a 'neverendum' issue. This perception is often expressed in a level of bitterness, anger and polarisation in parts of our national political culture, which are not conducive to the compromises required in a healthy democracy. \r My suggestion aims to address this polarisation, while also respecting the following principles:\r - that the people of Scotland are sovereign\r - that the people of Scotland have the right under international law to self-determination\r - that neither of these rights can be or should be relinquished\r - that the 2014 independence referendum did not, and does not prevent the people of Scotland revisiting the issue of independence at a time of their choosing.\r I believe Scotland can usefully take inspiration from Northern Ireland's constitutional arrangements with respect to a border poll. Namely that such a poll cannot be held more often than once every 7 years.  In taking inspiration here, I note that Scotland does not (thankfully) have Northern Ireland's history of community violence, nor its levels of political and sectarian polarisation.\r I suggest that the referendum bill should contain a clause along the following lines.\r That an independence referendum must not be held unless one of the following conditions are met:\r - at least 7 years have passed since the last independence referendum\r - or there has been a significant change in the constitutional order of the UK\r An independent body, set up by the Scottish Parliament, should be responsible for determining whether such a "significant change" has occurred. \r The bill should also note that the UK vote to leave the European Union constitutes such a "significant change".\r I believe that such a good faith clause would benefit relations amongst the nations of the UK, which would be beneficial even if Scotland were to vote for independence. Furthermore I believe it would help reduce some of the polarisation of Scottish politics around the question of independence, and therefore promote greater harmony in Scotland.</td>

The SNP must consider how much Scotland would have to pay to the EU. At the moment the UK BORROWS £350 million each week, increasing debt every week.  Can Scotland afford to do the same or being a member of the EU bankrupt Scotland.\r3. The EU opened their door to illiterate migrants who have no intention of working. They come to Europe expecting Free housing, food, school, clothes and spending money... When England UK Refuses entry, they will be sent to Scotland. Most Scottish people don't want this.\r4. The EU will send tens of thousands of Muslims who do not want to integrate into the Scottish way of life...  They look at women not wearing a Niqab or Burqa as not-being respected... This is extremely divisive. Many employers will not employ a person wearing a Niqab or Burqa so the state will end up supporting them and their kids.\r5. England and Wales is Scotland's largest market... Not the EU...  The EU could force the UK and Scotland to apply customs duties to each others goods....  No Winners.</td>

      <td>It is disappointing that this consultation takes it as read that there is actually support for another referendum. I voted to remain as part of Europe and I voted for the SNP after the last Scottish referendum on independence but I did not want my vote to be used to justify another referendum. The referendum that resulted in 'Brexit' did not ask if Scotland should remain as part of the EU, but if the UK should. Just because a high majority of Scots want the UK to remain in Europe does not mean that we want Scotland to remain in Europe alone.\r The cost of a referendum is high; both in terms of finance and in terms of emotional/societal expense. Please do not put us through another referendum again so soon after the last. The good work that the SNP has done in managing the country should continue but do not be a one policy party. One day there will be independence but let it be at the right time. Walking out on the UK whilst there are uncertainties over 'Brexit' will damage the position of our friends, neighbours and families. It is irresponsible to make such a move at the moment as it could have catastropic consequences across the region.\r Please take a few years to demonstrate that Scotland can support itself financially and build a robust case before we are put through the divisive debates that undermine everyone as there is a lack of facts when they are needed. We are exhausted by the continuous process and the bombardment of shallow arguments from both sides. People are passionate and want change but I am unsure our society is ready for the debate again so soon after the last; the wounds are still healing.\r The SNP are a good party and Scotland is envied across much of the wider UK - don't undermine our standing by being stand-offish with our neighbours and don't undermine your citizens by asking us the same question again so soon after we gave you an answer. If the vote was to become independent last time, would there be a scramble now to ask if we wanted to rejoin the UK rather than be left alone in Europe?\r If there must be a referendum, which I hope there isn't, the terms in the consultation are sound.</td>

      <td>While I agree that the referendum is about people in Scotland, there must be cast iron guarantees that EU citizens can take place after the brexit process begins. They cannot lose the right to take part as it will further alienate them from the country as so much damage has been done by the UK Government so far. \r Also, I do think that people abroad should be able to take part in this. Many Scots overseas were dismayed that they could not take part in 2014, yet they can register to take part in elections. A system whereby someone has lived in Scotland in the past 5 years, still owns property in Scotland or is working abroad but still resides in Scotland otherwise should also be part of the franchise if they can prove this and are willing to vote. For many Scots abroad, independence may bring them home.</td>

      <td>I am strongly of the opinion that any constitutional change of this magnitude needs to require a more than “50% of votes counted” threshold.\rMost corporations have super-majority requirements to enable significant changes to their Memorandums of Association and constitutions; likewise with clubs and societies.\rGeneral elections, where the result can be reversed at the end of a term do not require such super-majority thresholds; but essentially irreversible decisions such as a country’s constitutional arrangements need to have the over-whelming support of the nation to be acceptable. \rThere are clear reasons for this – not least a super-majority decision disallows the perpetual dissatisfaction with close results – as we are seeing with the Brexit referendum and indeed the 2014 Independence poll.\rThose calling for Independence should have the confidence that they can win a 2/3rds majority of voters to their cause if they really believe in it. Winning Independence by a slim margin will create a hugely divided nation – and as with the Brexit poll also leave room for ‘voters regret’ when clarity appears after the smoke of the electoral battle. That is bad for democracy and bad for the country.\rIf the Independence lobby is prepared to put a 2/3rds majority pass rate – I will wholeheartedly  support their position to run a further referendum.</td>
      <td>There are a large number of Scots who consider themselves Scottish to the core but have spent their working lives outside of Scotland, many of whom plan to return to Scotland at some stage. The future of Scotland is as precious to them as to those currently resident here.\rIt would seem appropriate that these people be allowed to vote; their right to do so being at least equal to those of EU citizens currently resident in Scotland but with no long-term attachment to the country who are eligible to vote.\rThere should be a provision for anyone born in Scotland with UK citizenship to be eligible to vote, regardless of their current residential location. \rThis is easily checked as place of birth is shown on all passports - so those Scots not currently resident in Scotland would then be able to apply for a referendum vote as long as their UK passport states they were born in Scotland. \rThis is not an unusual provision - see USA as example.</td>

UK joined the EU ,UK voted to leave the EU and we in the UK will be leaving the EU .Scotland was not voting to stay or leave the EU ,UK was .Scotland,s deficit is 9.5 to join the EU for the very first time ,first it has to be a sovereign country ,have a deficit below 3 .0 and accept the Euro ,like all newcomers have to accept on joining. That is if they would even consider Scotland to be a member.  Scotland then will be dictated too by EU and not have any sort of independence. It was embarrassing for Nicola,Sturgeon  to ask Obama for allowing a tax from ex-pats that now live in the USA (History The Boston Tea Party )Obama told her and must think she is mental and desperate for money to want to tax every born Scots that now live else where in the world. Police Scotland and central call centers have been a disaster ,and a danger to the police in Dumfrieshire .NHS I worked for 42 years with them and staffing has deteriorated . Food Banks for starving children in Scotland .My Mum locked away by force without being sectioned for mental health and her property and savings taken from her ,her bungalow  sold  and her savings drained ,family now have to pay for her  personal needs as her pension also claimed by social services .

Firstly I would like to retain a copy of how I voted and my vote held online for me to check how I voted. I would also like to see this for postal votes. It's very easy to have a tear off slip to keep and then the voter slip with voting identifiers uploaded to a database online that can be checked by the voter. I feel this is a more robust system that protects the legitimacy of the final result. In terms of security of the vote we need independent officers to conduct how the vote is being held and to inspect polling papers. As in 2014 my paper did not have any bar code or number on the back which I now check at all elections.</td>

      <td>I support the Scottish peoples Right of Sovereignty, in that we as a nation should be given the chance to choose who rules, or governs, us. I realise an independence referendum is desired, in order to fully judge how large a majority exists for independence. However, many Scots, myself included, have serious concerns about the process of the referendum itself, about security, vote counting issues and various matters that have never, sadly, been addressed by the Scottish Government. As such, many of us are now distrustful of the referendum voting process. If ScotGov can at some point address those concerns or at least let Scots know that security will be scrutinisable, and *there*, that England/WM will have NO hand in the actual process and votes will NOT be going into England to be counted or otherwise processed, if an outside (perhaps European?) objective body can oversee the referendum process with full co operation from ScotGov and without hinderance, then great! We NEED independence, I cannot tell you just how much, or how many of us are counting on it so that we can realise the long frustrated dream of living in a free Scotland who runs her own affairs, without manipulation or dictation from London, who takes her place in the wider world as an outward looking, progressive, thriving and entirely wholesome country. The alternative, of more austerity measures, more block budget cuts, more punishments meted out to Scotland for daring to want to be governed by Scots, by the people who live in Scotland, is unacceptable. On a personal note, I am married to a European man. And whilst he's felt nothing but welcome here in Scotland, the recent xenophobia and anti European rhetoric and policy coming out of the UK rightly horrifies him. He has said if Scotland does not go independent, we will move to Belgium. And I do not blame him one bit. The vitriol, the hatred, coming out of England beggars belief. So for us, at least, a "working relationship" in which Scotland remains in the UK, even as an EU member, is not for us. Because ultimately, Scotland will STILL be run by Westminster, and still be subject to legal changes and harmful policy that even the SNP will be unable to stop. \rAnd if we have to leave? Call it emotional, extreme, what have you, it's the truth...it will break my heart to leave my home, the country I was born to, the country that educated me, raised me, has fed and homed me almost to my old age. And it's partly because I've lived this life, so long under WM rule and so long on the end of the harm the UK does, that if we don't grasp independence this time round, I will not end my days in thrall to England. That is not racism or anti English sentiment. I have constantly asked supporters of the Union to give me at least one good reason for remaining. The only one who responded came up with "British values". Those are not my values, not Scots values. I am not xenophobic, and I will never advocate counting the teeth of children before they can seek refuge in my country! And that is what we'd be leaving, upon going.\rSo please, Scotgov, find some way of rescuing Scotland. Find the way of getting us out of harm's way, and towards a brighter, saner, more humane future. Not just for folks like me or my husband, but for the children of Scotland who should not, in the 21st C, be exposed to such trash as is coming out of the south. Please. For them.</td>

The material change is not yet confirmed.\r So the question should not be a simple repeat of 2014, but whether Scotland should be an independent country *on Brexit*.\r Scotland has chosen to remain in both the UK and the EU; natural justice demands the opportunity to choose between those.\r Those voters who change their minds because of the threat of Brexit would not be well served if they voted for independence because of it, and then the UK reversed its decision and remained in the European Union.</td>

      <td>These 5 questions completely miss the point.  The fundamental question is whether the Bill should be permitted to reach this stage.\r The current Scottish Government was not elected with a clear mandate that the Scottish Parliament should have the right to hold an independence referendum. Furthermore, it does not hold a majority. There is no clear and sustained evidence that independence has become the preferred option of a majority of the Scottish people. There has not been a significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014 because the question in the EU referendum was asked as a UK question. As such, nobody has the right to claim Scotland is being taken out of the EU against its will. Many people in Scotland voted Remain 'tactically' to avoid precisely the situation that is now being 'manufactured', and if the question was asked in different circumstances would have voted out. In fact, a higher proportion of SNP supporters voted out than those of any other party.\r Scotland did not vote to remain in the EU (read the referendum question!) and thus the right to hold an independence referendum is irrelevant. Furthermore, it is a matter for Westminster to determine, as only they can legislate for a legally binding referendum to be held.\r The Scottish Government is hereby publishing for consultation a draft Referendum bill without the authority of the U.K. Parliament and seeking the view of the Scottish people on independence is a waste of taxpayers' money. The best and only way to protect Scotland’s interests in the wake of the EU referendum are to fall in line with the U.K. negotiating position and respect the democratic wishes of 17.5m U.K. Citizens. \r The economic case for independence is far more feeble than that in 2014. Furthermore, E.U. Membership, as the desired but highly unlikely outcome does not represent independence. \r The majority of Scottish people do not favour another referendum. Business and employers do not want the uncertainty of another referendum.\r It is therefore extremely disappointing that the 5 questions in this consultation ignore the fundamental issues of how the majority feel, and instead ask about how such a referendum would be operated and managed.</td>

      <td>As there is no actual question from the Scottish Government about whether or not the people of Scotland actually want this referendum, this seems like the right place to put it.\r It is time for the Scottish Government to actually focus on running this country and not obsessing over a second referendum. The vote was decided in 2014 and the issue should be laid to rest. The country does not need the division of the independence referendum again and following the EU referendum result, we cannot afford to have even more economic certainty.\r The fact there isn't even an option on this "consultation" for rejecting the idea of a second referendum shows how out of touch this administration really are. By all means let's work together with the U.K. Government to ensure the best deal for Scotland in the face of Brexit but let's make the most of the opportunities that it'll bring. \r I voted remain but did not do so for us to be ripped out of the U.K.</td>

As a voter in both the Scottish and Europe union referendums I knew what the risks were to Scotland if we voted to remain in the U.K. And if we also left the union. The Scottish referendum tore the country apart there was a horrible atmosphere around Glasgow that day I do not want our country torn apart. I think it would be better if we had our first minister instead insuring we got the best of brexit and not weaken our currency anymore than it is just now. I live in govanhill in Glasgow and to be honest I don't care about brexit right now I care about the state of the place where I live the children who are not in school the rouge landlords who are making govanhill a wasteland. I work full time and when I walk down Allison street I see fully capable people standing in the street just hanging out and it angers me that nothing is being done. Please first minister listen to the people of Scotland even your old constituency fix us first and sort independence later.</td>

The reason being that they wouldn't have been able to cope on the night due to the massive volume of postal votes in the region of 30,000. Previously around 4000. I was so flabbergasted with this that I covered this again over the phone to ensure that I had my facts right.\r I would appreciate if someone could check if postal votes went to England for scanning and if the 'practice' in Renfrewshire was carried out across Scotland.

      <td>Mostly fine. There is no mention of where postal votes would be counted and who would be allowed to "sample" them. It seems that postal votes should also be retained and counted within the local authority area rather than sent to England or outsourced to an external company. Sampling prior to the official count should not be allowed by anyone who is part of a campaign (cf. Ruth Davidson's comments prior to the referendum day). Due to the seriousness of the implications of the referendum it seems that there should be neutral observers from abroad as well as the standard government staff. Regarding the role of the Electoral Commission - There were a number of complaints made during the 2014 referendum campaign about a) deliberately misleading postal election material b) deliberately misleading telephone campaigning c) Breaking of purdah. The electoral commission only appears to allow for complaints about funding or misrepresentation of candidates, but did not allow reporting of these issues. Can the electoral commission extend its capabilities to include reporting of such issues or another body be appointed to investigate such issues?</td>

Also we need to put the oil issue to bed, make sure you have the answers and mention the fact that trident is preventing the west from being utilised for the better of our economy, maybe even go as far as nationalising the oil along with the electricity markets, to give the poorest a good chance on improving there odds of living comfortable, like all Scots should, and finally the EU, I believe we need to be in the EU, and I know many (well 38%) don't want this, we need to show actual proof that we won't just be standing by the sidelines like we have in Westminster, show the people that the EU needs us as much as we need them, with all our oil, wind, water, sea, fish, etc. We need to show how strong we will be, but most importantly we need to show that it won't be all milk and honey and be truthful to the public, tell them it will be hard at first, and that it won't be rosy straight away, show them you are realistic and that, in say 20 years Scotland will be strong in the world and seen for who we were always meant to be, a proud, strong, smart, caring country.</td>

We need the rules to be similar to last time, in the way we were able to print off any yes stuff, without contacting headquarters (Yes Scotland), oh and this time round, improve the communication between yes groups and Yes Scotland, last time was a nightmare, we had to go all over the place to get supplies, we did make our own too.</td>

Could votes be counted within polling stations, with strict vigilance and numbers be passed to a central location. \r Stringent procedures are required, to encourage trust and participation in the referendum.</td>

In a sense, it can be argued that the media is a campaigning tool. Since the media is predominantly owned by Conservatives, which are of unionist persuasion. The media were utterly hostile towards the YES campaign and those leading the campaign. In addition, I witnessed several obscene comments. \r The mainstream media should be better regulated, during elections, due to bias.</td>

This is a waste of taxpayers money and an excuse to divide this country even more. Aceept this was a UK wide decision, Scotland knew that when voting. Focus on fixing the mess youve made of our public services and stop being anti-democratic, i mean we know youre party is xenophobic and has alot of communists.</td>

      <td>There should be no referendum.  There was a once in a generation vote.  Remain won and the result should be respected.</td>
      <td>The question should not be yes/no if a referendum is held. Yes is a positive statement and is a biased question.  If a vote is held the questions should be do you wish to remain in the uk or do you wish to leave the uk</td>
